That is to say, analytical chemistry is the combination of art and science of determining what matter is (identification) and how much of it (quantification) exists. Analytical chemistry also focuses on improvements in experimental design, chemometrics, and the creation of new measurement tools to provide better chemical information. Analytical chemistry has applications in forensics, bioanalysis, clinical analysis, environmental analysis and materials analysis. As a scientific field which has such great diversity in its application, students trained in this programme will surely be in great demand in chemical related industries.

The Analytical Chemistry programme prepares graduates with the foundation to use their knowledge of chemistry, instrumentation, computer, and statistics to solve problems in almost all areas of chemistry and for all kinds of industries. For example, their measurements are used to assure the safety and quality of food, pharmaceuticals, and water; to assure compliance with environmental and other regulations; to support the legal process; to help physicians diagnose diseases; and to provide measurements and documentation essential to trade and commerce.

This programme equips students with technical knowledge of analytical chemistry. The students will also be made aware of international standards that bound them to the society and industry. They will have an opportunity to work with industry through their internship and to carry out a real-life research project on analytical chemistry. All such training will add value to their qualification and later to their employment opportunities.

This programme is endorsed by Institut Kimia Malaysia (IKM). Graduates of this programme can join IKM as a member and hence recognised as a ‘Registered Chemist’ in Malaysia.", Duration:3 years,"STPM: Minimum Grade C in 2 relevant subjects which must include Chemistry

Bachelor of Science in Architecture (Honours),"Architecture is the art and science of building. The word ‘architecture’ was derived from Latin word ‘architectura’ and Greek word ‘arkitekton’, which mean ‘master builder’. As a trained professional and very often the lead player in building projects, an architect is entrusted with transforming the client’s need for space into reality. An architect is usually involved in all aspects related to the design, construction and commissioning of a building project. In the private sector, an architect may be employed in an architectural consultancy firm. After gaining suitable experience, he/she may decide to set up his/her own private practice.

The Bachelor of Science in Architecture (Honours) programme serves as Part I of the architectural education on the pathway towards the registration as Architect. As one of the accredited architecture courses in Malaysia, the programme is designed to cater for students who wish to pursue the career of architecture and practice as architects in Malaysia. For candidates without the requisite pre-university qualification, they may choose to complete the Diploma in Architecture programme first before they are promoted to the degree study on credit transfer.

Candidates for architectural studies are expected to have an interest in art and design, an ability to appreciate form and space, a love for heritage and culture, as well as an ability to appreciate all the five human senses. Students in this programme go through lectures, tutorials, laboratories, group discussions, seminars and studio works in which they learn draughting skills both manually and by using computer aided design (CAD) tools. Subjects covered in the programme include Design Studios, Design Theory, Construction Technology and Materials, Structural Studies, Environmental Science, Building Services, History of Architecture, Building By-Laws, Digital Modelling, Architectural Drawing etc.",Duration:3 years,"STPM: Minimum Grade C in 2 relevant subjects listed in Schedule A
