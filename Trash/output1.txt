Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Analytical Chemistry

Programme Overview:
Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of natural and artificial materials. That is to say, analytical chemistry is the combination of art and science of determining what matter is (identification) and how much of it (quantification) exists. Analytical chemistry also focuses on improvements in experimental design, chemometrics, and the creation of new measurement tools to provide better chemical information. Analytical chemistry has applications in forensics, bioanalysis, clinical analysis, environmental analysis and materials analysis. As a scientific field which has such great diversity in its application, students trained in this programme will surely be in great demand in chemical related industries.
The Analytical Chemistry programme prepares graduates with the foundation to use their knowledge of chemistry, instrumentation, computer, and statistics to solve problems in almost all areas of chemistry and for all kinds of industries. For example, their measurements are used to assure the safety and quality of food, pharmaceuticals, and water; to assure compliance with environmental and other regulations; to support the legal process; to help physicians diagnose diseases; and to provide measurements and documentation essential to trade and commerce.
This programme equips students with technical knowledge of analytical chemistry. The students will also be made aware of international standards that bound them to the society and industry. They will have an opportunity to work with industry through their internship and to carry out a real-life research project on analytical chemistry. All such training will add value to their qualification and later to their employment opportunities.
This programme is endorsed by Institut Kimia Malaysia (IKM). Graduates of this programme can join IKM as a member and hence recognised as a ‘Registered Chemist’ in Malaysia.
